# hello-world

This is the practice project on github.
Created a new repository with a default readme file
Creates a default branch:  main
Created a new branch:  readme-edits
Makes a copy (of the whole repository?) + becomes the active branch
Editing this file on github
About to commit these changes to the current (readme-edits) branch
Going to check my local copy (the changes should not be there)
About to see about "submitting" a pull request + discussion + approval + merge into the master branch
Going to check my local copy (the changes should be there)
